# Books-Courses
This repository will contain all the books and courses I have completed in the field of computer science

1. The first book I will be fully reading is Bjarne Stroustrup's, "Programming Principles and Practice Using C++ 3rd edition." I picked this book because Stroustrup himself created C++. I also saw it on stack overflow stating that it is one of the very few C++ books that build good habits and are very beginner friendly. I hope to learn C++ throughouly in order to supplement my interests in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.
