# Books-Courses
This repository will contain all the books and courses I have completed in the field of computer science

1. The first book I will be fully reading Eric Matthes, "Python Crash Course" the third edition. I selected this book because I want to specialize in Aritificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) in the future. The beginner friendly layout of the book also added to it's appeal, with part 1 mainly teaching programming concepts supplemented with exercises to further reinforce what you have read and part 2 which consists of mini projects to hone the skills that you have learned throughout the book. 

2. The first course that I will be going through is the UMICH "python for everybody" course on coursera. I was attracted to this course because of the abundance of praise for it's thorough yet beginner friendly style. I am doing this course alongside the Python Crash Course book because it is vital that I have some guidance from experts in python, such as those teacing the course.
